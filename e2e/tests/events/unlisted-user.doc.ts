# Unlisted Events (User)

Some events are marked as "unlisted" by organizers. These events do not appear in public event lists. If you receive a direct link (and have access to the registration options), you can still open the event page.

What this means for you:

- Event list shows only visible, approved events
- Unlisted events are hidden from the list
- A direct link to an unlisted event will still work when shared with you

If an event is shared with you directly, open the link you were given to access the event details and register (if registration options are available to your account).
