# Handoff — 2026-02-14

## Scope Completed

- Integrated `@heddendorp/effect-platform-angular` usage into the Angular app bootstrap:
  - Added `provideEffectHttpClient()` and `provideEffectRpcProtocolHttpLayer({ url: resolveRpcUrl })` in `/Users/hedde/code/evorto/src/app/app.config.ts`.
- Reworked RPC client bootstrap in `/Users/hedde/code/evorto/src/app/core/effect-rpc-angular-client.ts`:
  - Preserved existing app API surface (`AppRpc.providers`, `AppRpc.injectClient()`).
  - Switched to a DI-backed bridge that consumes `EFFECT_RPC_PROTOCOL_HTTP_LAYER` and constructs the typed Effect Angular RPC client in an environment injector.
- Updated dependencies in `/Users/hedde/code/evorto/package.json`:
  - Added `@heddendorp/effect-platform-angular@0.0.7`.

## Validation Ran

- `bun run lint:fix` (passes with existing warnings only)
- `bun run lint:check` (passes with existing warnings only)
- `bun run build:app` (passes)

## Known Follow-up

- Bun package manager operations (`bun add`, `bun install`) currently hang at dependency resolution in this workspace. Dependency installation for this milestone was unblocked via `npm`, then source-level verification was completed with Bun build/lint scripts. This needs a dedicated pass to restore fully Bun-native dependency/lockfile lifecycle.
