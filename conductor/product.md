# Product Definition

## Summary

Evorto is a white-label platform for associations (especially student associations like ESN sections) to run their organization and events end-to-end. It combines association operations with public-facing event discovery and registration, so admins can run repeating semester cycles while visitors can browse and sign up with a branded experience.

## Target Users

- Primary buyers: association admins/board members.
- Core operators: event organizers/volunteers.
- Public visitors: non-members who discover and register for events.

## Problems We Solve

- Admin overhead from repeating, semester-based event cycles.
- Fragmented tools for member, knowledge, and event management.
- Lack of coherent branding and public pages in free ticketing tools.

## Core Value Proposition

A single, association-specific system that reduces operational burden, supports recurring workflows, and provides a branded public face for events and membership.

## Key Differentiators

- White-label, association-branded landing pages.
- Recurring event workflows (semester cadence, approvals, templates).
- Member + knowledge management tightly integrated with events.
- ESN-specific features where applicable.

## Business Outcomes

- Reduce administrative effort and operational costs.
- Improve organizational quality via structured approval/knowledge flows.
- Maintain a strong public presence that converts visitors into participants.

## Constraints / Non-Goals

- Must remain white-label with per-association branding and domains.
- Keep the product simple; avoid unnecessary complexity.
- ESN-specific logic must be optional and never make the platform useful exclusively for ESN sections.
- Solo development: prioritize readability over cleverness, document every module, and record decisions as they are made.
