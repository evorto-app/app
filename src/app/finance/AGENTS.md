# Finance Module Guidelines

- Keep money values consistent and explicit in smallest currency units where required.
- Preserve typed mapping across receipt/transaction RPC contracts and UI view models.
- Keep approval/review/refund flows aligned with current Effect RPC handlers.
- Do not introduce ad-hoc runtime/storage clients; use existing server integration paths.
