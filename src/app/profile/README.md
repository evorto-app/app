# Profile Feature Notes

## ESNcard UX intent
- Show ESNcard management only when the tenant has the provider enabled.
- Allow users to add/refresh/remove a card; validation happens on save and stores expiry.
- When enabled and the user has no valid card, show the "Buy ESNcard" CTA if configured.
- Keep ESNcard flows out of the profile experience when the provider is disabled.
